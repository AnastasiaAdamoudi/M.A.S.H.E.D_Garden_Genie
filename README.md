# Garden Genie Frontend

For the final full stack project at the School of Code, my team had the opportunity to address a real-world problem and plan, design and develop a full-stack web app within five weeks.

### The challenge:
Simplify gardening for individuals, addressing the common barriers that often deter people from starting their gardening journey.

### Our solution:
An app that delivers personalised plant recommendations based on user preferences. On the frontend, we harnessed the power of React for its code reusability, state management, and seamless deployment, to create a high-functionint frontend. For the backend, we efficiently managed plant data using Node, Express, and MongoDB in a non-relational database.
